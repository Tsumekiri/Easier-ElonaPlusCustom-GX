# Elona+ Custom-GX 2.31

*\~Believe in Jure and hold a determination to mince.\~*

---

Personal Project to change Overdose mode into an easier game mode (basically cheating). It includes:

- No item weight
- No magic spellstock usage
- Increased max trained potential to 999
- Receive p + 10 PP on each quest
- Removed death-crest mechanic
- Plants will not wither
- Harvesting plants will drop 1 seed
- Blackjack will not use up your chips
- Player can cheat indefinitely in blackjack
- Can eat indefinitely

As I said, basically a cheaty Overdose mode. Otherwise, it stays the same as the main repository.

I probably won't be keeping this fork up-to-date, as it's just a project I made for fun to learn the language used to make Elona+.

Elona+ Custom-GX is a new variant of Elona+ based on Elona+ Custom-G, updated with the changes in Elona+ up to version 2.31.

It is originally created and maintained by [Ruin0x11](https://github.com/Ruin0x11), on [this repository](https://github.com/Ruin0x11/ElonaPlusCustom-GX).  
This repository is an unofficial continuation of the above repository using Ruin0x11's [borscht/erystia](https://github.com/Ruin0x11/borscht) decompiler.

## Installation

1. Download Elona+ 2.31 from [here](https://mega.nz/file/0GMlHRbR#kTWClL8QeUb0WiB_ZtRoW0nqtkya9mmSu7tB7dOjrYc). Extract it to `elonaplus2.31`.
2. Extract the contents of Custom-GX's archive to the `elonaplus2.31` folder, overwriting all existing files.
3. Run `elonapluscgx.exe`.

## Building (You don't need this for playing.)

1. Follow the installation instructions above. Rename the `elonaplus2.31` folder to `2.05-custom-gx` and move it to the `assets/` folder of this repository.
2. Download the HSP3.4 SDK (`hsp34a.zip`) from [here](http://hsp.tv/make/downlist.html) and extract it somewhere.
3. Copy `hsplua.dll` from the `2.05-custom-gx` folder into the HSP3.4 SDK folder. Otherwise, you'll get an error saying it's missing when running the game from the editor.
4. Open `2.05-custom-gx/main.hsp` with `hsed3.exe` from the HSP3.4 SDK folder. Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to compile and run under debug mode.
5. Press <kbd>Ctrl+F9</kbd> to create an executable named `elonapluscgx.exe`. You can then copy it to your Custom-GX install folder.

**Warning**: If you make any changes to the code, *always make sure the file encoding is set to SHIFT_JIS!* Otherwise, you'll get a lot of cryptic compiler errors.
